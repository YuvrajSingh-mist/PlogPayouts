## Overview

Green Plog is a revolutionary platform that combines fitness, environmental awareness, and technology to create a cleaner, greener world. Users can actively contribute to the environment by engaging in "plogging," an activity that involves jogging while picking up litter. The platform leverages cutting-edge technologies such as AI, ML, and NLP to enhance user experiences and make a positive impact.

## Features

### 1. Reward System
   - Earn points for each piece of litter collected during plogging.
   - Redeem points for eco-friendly products, discounts, or contribute to charitable causes.

### 2. Map Location
   - AI and ML dynamically highlight areas with higher concentrations of litter on the map.
   - Users can plan their plogging routes based on real-time data and historical patterns.

### 3. Blog System
   - Share plogging experiences, environmental tips, and success stories through the integrated blog system.
   - AI-driven content recommendations ensure personalized and relevant blog suggestions.

## How It Works

1. **Plogging:**
   - Users engage in plogging activities, collecting litter during their jogging sessions.
   - The platform uses image recognition to classify the type of trash collected, providing insights into the composition of waste.

2. **Reward System:**
   - Points are awarded for each item picked up.
   - ML algorithms incentivize proper sorting and recycling, rewarding users for environmentally friendly practices.

3. **Map Location:**
   - AI algorithms analyze user data to predict areas with higher litter accumulation.

4. **Blog System:**
   - Share plogging achievements, tips, and environmental insights through the integrated blog system.

## Technologies Used

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript,Bootstrap for the frontend.
- Django and Python for the backend.
- TensorFlow and PyTorch for image recognition and classification.
